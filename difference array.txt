Difference array D[i] of a given array A[i] is defined as D[i] = A[i]-A[i-1] (for 0 < i < N ) and D[0] = A[0] considering 0 based indexing. Difference array can be used to perform range update queries "l r x" where l is left index, r is right index and x is value to be added and after all queries you can return original array from it. Where update range operations can be performed in O(1) complexity.
update(l, r, x) : Add x to D[l] and subtract it from D[r+1], i.e., we do D[l] += x, D[r+1] -= x
printArray() : Do A[0] = D[0] and print it. For rest of the elements, do A[i] = A[i-1] + D[i] and print them.
